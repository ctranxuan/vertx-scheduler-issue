A small project to show there may be a memory leak using Vert.x
schedulers and RxJava infinite streams.

The different png provided show the memory evolution with different
schedulers.

With the Vert.x schedulers the memory grows fast and is never garbaged.
With RxJava schedulers the memory is garbaged.

== Environment used

- Vertx 3.5.0
- Java 10 (Java 8)
- Linux Ubuntu

== How to run?

Run the main of the class `WorkerIssue` (with for example -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m) and profile the memory
with a JVM tool (VisualVM, async-profile, etc.)
